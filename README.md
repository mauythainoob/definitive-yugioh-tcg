# Yugioh: Definitive Mechanics and Rulings

A single, definitive source to explain the rulings and mechanics for the YuGiOh! (TCG).

## Inspiration
There are an array of opinions and misunderstandings regarding the rules and mechanics of YuGiOh! (the author is no exception). This results in misinformation spreading, leading to widely accepted but incorrect interpretations of the rules. While this guide cannot completely prevent such misunderstandings, it aims to be the "go-to" resource for explaining the fundamental mechanics of YuGiOh!

Additionally, questions like "If I use Book of Moon on a monster special summoned from the extra deck, does it forget where it came from?" is a genuine question but where does this come from? The intent is to find and provide official or widely accepted rulings on such questions and explain why.

## Sources
The guide does not intend to replace existing sources, such as the [Official Rulebook](https://img.yugioh-card.com/en/downloads/rulebook/SD_RuleBook_EN_10.pdf). Instead, it extrapolates vital information and presents it in an easy-to-digest and searchable manner. Additionally, any information presented in this guide will be backed by official or widely accepted rulings to provide authority.

## Note
The answers below reflect the default rules or mechanics of the game. Card text takes precedence over general mechanics.
